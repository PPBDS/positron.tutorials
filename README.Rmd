### Positron Tutorials

The core tutorials introduce students to the Positron integrated development environment.

- *Positron and Code* ("01-code"). Introduce students to Positron and to writing R code in simple scripts. 

- *Positron and Quarto* ("02-quarto"). Demonstrate more tricks for working with R code using Positron, and also explain Quarto documents. 

- *Terminal* ("03-terminal"). Teach the command line. 

- *Positron and GitHub Introduction* ("04-github-1").  Explain the basics of Git and GitHub, mostly in the context of Positron.

- *Positron and GitHub Advanced* ("05-github-2"). Provide more practice in working with Git/GitHub, including more details on the use of GitHub Pages. 

- *Quarto Websites Introduction* ("06-websites-1"). Demonstrate the basics of website construction using Quarto projects.  

- *Quarto Websites Advanced* ("07-websites-2"). Practice Quarto websites, with a focus on splitting data analysis tasks into separate files. 

### R for Data Science

These tutorials cover material from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) (R4DS) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. There are five related tutorials in the package: `r4ds-1`, `r4ds-2`, `r4ds-3`, `r4ds-4`, and `r4ds-5`. Different tutorials cover different chapters from the book as follows.

#### r4ds-1

Data import  
Data visualization  
Data transformations  
Data tidying  

#### r4ds-2

Spreadsheets  
Layers  
Exploratory data analysis  
Communication  

#### r4ds-3

Databases  
Logical vectors  
Numbers  
Strings  
Regular expressions  

#### r4ds-4

Arrow  
Factors  
Dates and times  
Missing values  
Joins  

#### r4ds-5

Hierarchical-data  
Web scraping  
Functions  
Iterations  

The organization of the tutorials is not the same as the organization of R4DS. Instead, each tutorial begins by sourcing data from a different sort of storage technology and then working with that data.

### Analyzing US Census Data

We have one tutorial, `tidycensus-1`, covering material from [*Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R*](https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html) by Kyle Walker.
