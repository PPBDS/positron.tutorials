## Priorities

Get rid of RPubs?

Clean up tutorial 7.

Add tutorial about ellmer and other AI issues.

Add a tutorial about working with large, complex projects? Each topic would involve forking an already existing project and then making a bunch of changes, perhaps including getting the raw data.

Add more AI questions. Need to make students practice interacting with AI.

Maybe an Advanced Positron tutorial? Covers topics like multiple Terminals and Consoles. Advanced Git/GitHub trickery, especially for when the Git history is rich. 

### Position issues

Here is a discussion of good naming conventions. Also, a useful image.

https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/discussions/6330#discussioncomment-12205188

Example phrasing: "The Console is located in the Panel beneath the Welcome page."

Other useful names: Activity Bar (far left), Primary Side Bar (next in; only appears if 
you choose something in the Activity Bar; disappears if you click on that thing again),
Editor (old Source pane), Panel (area lower left by default, with Console) 
Secondary Side Bar (raw right, with objects like Viewer and Plots). Not clear what 
differentiates the Panel from the Secondary Side Bar.

`Command + \`` to switch between Positron windows.

This Yoube is good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jhTjOK4vQ8

Note that guide to using the plot window, toward the end, 
especially just adding plotly::ggplot() and, thereby, making the current plot
interactive. I also like the examination of the different panels (Variables, Data, Values) 
below Session.

## Things to do earlier

In total, we make 5 websites. We need to make their construction more consistent, making things simpler in the initial ones and more complex, with more skipped steps, in later ones. Students will probably be doing all these within a day or two.

For later websites, show how to add a link to the website to the GitHub repo.

There are lots of questions when we ask the student to copy the HTML output. We need to explicitly teach them how to do this, and mention it again.

> We often ask you to "copy" from the HTML. It is OK if what you copy looks ugly, has lost its formatting and so on. We just want to make sure that your HTML includes, more or less, the information that it should.

Early on, explain that we often just follow the answer with our answer, without labelling it as such. Explain that an example answer after your answer is just an example, yours may differ for all sorts of reasons. Add this to first tutorial.

Explain `Ctrl + C` someplace early, and maybe a second time. Use sleep(5) and sleep(60) as an example. Probably belongs in the Terminal.

We could do all the example repos in PPBDS and then leave them up forever, so they would be available to students doing the work.

## Other items

Any reason to make the Tutorial descriptions longer, like a full sentence or two?

If we ever redo the images, make sure to delete the Positron default welcome page first. 

Do we teach how to use `cat` in Terminal? We need to!

Any reason to explore the Visual editor?

Ask Posit why `Cmd + Shift + K` does quarto preview as opposed to quarto render?

find . -type f -name "*.png" -exec pngquant "{}" -o "{}" --force \;

Just added those .txt files on 03-terminal/images. Is that a good place for them? We don't (?) want them to be in the actual package. Should we add them to .RBuildignore?

Positron GitHub Announcement that there was now the ability to create a second Console easily. Do I want this? Would it be useful for tutorials?

Update R CMD check YAML to be more like tutorial.helpers, using renv and multiple OS's.

 ## AI Links

Apparently, there is active work on a Positron Assistant. More evidence that we are correct to leave RStudio behind.

## Other tutorials

Maybe we need another tutorial about putting large projects together. Might cover things like the **here** package. Cover material in book titled something like R Stuff that it is not in the manual.

Maybe a different tutorial which walked through a bunch of different Quarto project types, not because we are especially interested in Dashboards, but because we want to give students more practice dealing with projects with lots of different files doing different things.
