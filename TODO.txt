## Priorities

Should the directory name (04-guthub-1) match the id (positron-and-github-1)? No?

Distinguish between render and preview.

Confirm the use of two Windows throughout.

Understand fully how Windows will work in the terminal in Positron, at least for modern window shells.

Revisit Terminal tutorial.
 
What about Chromebooks??!! Too much to worry about. 

use Grok to provide one sentence descriptions for each tutorial, and then use that description in two places: the file itself and the home page of the package.

Standardize one whether we are teaching them the one window or two window approach. Or maybe we show them both and then standardize on two window since restarting the tutorial is so annoying.

Build VS Code extension for seeing/starting tutorials.

Shrink all PNG files.

Clean up tutorial 7.

Add tutorial about ellmer and other AI issues.

Add a tutorial about working with large, complex projects? Each topic would involve forking an already existing project and then making a bunch of changes, perhaps including getting the raw data.

Add more AI questions. Need to make students practice interacting with AI.

Can we add some tests? Maybe set up a test environment of some type, perhaps by setting up all sets of scaffolding for testthat? 



Maybe an Advanced Positron tutorial? Covers topics like multiple Terminals and Consoles. Advanced Git/GitHub trickery, especially for when the Git history is rich. 

## Things to do earlier

In total, we make 5 websites. We need to make their construction more consistent, making things simpler in the initial ones and more complex, with more skipped steps, in later ones. Students will probably be doing all these within a day or two.

For later websites, show how to add a link to the website to the GitHub repo.

There are lots of questions when we ask the student to copy the HTML output. We need to explicitly teach them how to do this, and mention it again.

> We often ask you to "copy" from the HTML. It is OK if what you copy looks ugly, has lost its formatting and so on. We just want to make sure that your HTML includes, more or less, the information that it should.

Early on, explain that we often just follow the answer with our answer, without labelling it as such. Explain that an example answer after your answer is just an example, yours may differ for all sorts of reasons. Add this to first tutorial.

Explain  someplace early, and maybe a second time. Use sleep(5) and sleep(60) as an example. Probably belongs in the Terminal.

We could do all the example repos in PPBDS and then leave them up forever, so they would be available to students doing the work.

## Other items

Any reason to make the Tutorial descriptions longer, like a full sentence or two?

If we ever redo the images, make sure to delete the Positron default welcome page first. 

Any reason to explore the Visual editor?

Ask Posit why `Cmd + Shift + K` does quarto preview as opposed to quarto render?

find . -type f -name "*.png" -exec pngquant "{}" -o "{}" --force \;

Just added those .txt files on 03-terminal/images. Is that a good place for them? We don't (?) want them to be in the actual package. Should we add them to .RBuildignore?

Update R CMD check YAML to be more like tutorial.helpers, using renv and multiple OS's.

 ## AI Links

Apparently, there is active work on a Positron Assistant.

## Other tutorials

Maybe we need another tutorial about putting large projects together. Might cover things like the **here** package. Cover material in book titled something like R Stuff that it is not in the manual.

Maybe a different tutorial which walked through a bunch of different Quarto project types, not because we are especially interested in Dashboards, but because we want to give students more practice dealing with projects with lots of different files doing different things.
